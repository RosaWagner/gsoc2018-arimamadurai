## Timeline for the Project

#### FORMAL RESEARCHES, SKETCHES FOR BASIC CHARACTERS IN BOTH THIN AND BLACK WEIGHTS

**May 14 – May 27**<br />
Investigating the original design + sketches of basic greek characters, finding balance between the different script sets.

**May 28 – June 10**<br />
First designs for basic greek characters in both weights.

**June 11 – June 14**<br />
Corrections.

**June 15**<br /> 
**Phase 1 Evaluation**

#### LOWERCASES, UPPERCASES, DIACRITICS FOR THE THIN WEIGHT + LOWERCASES FOR THE BLACK WEIGHT

**June 16 - June 29**<br />
Lowercase character set for the thin weight.

**June 39 – July 7**<br />
Uppercase character set for the thin weight.

**July 7 – July 12**<br />
Lowercase character set for the black weight.

**July 13**<br />
**Phase 2 Evaluation**

#### UPPERCASES, DIACRITICS FOR THE BLACK WEIGHT + KERNINGS + INTERPOLATION

**July 13 – July 28**<br />
Uppercase character set for the black weight.

**July 28 – August 5**<br />
Diacritics + kernings + interpolation [selection of the intermediate weights, fixing interpolation compatibility issues, completing the 8 weights].

**August 21 – August 28**<br />
Final week dedicated to eventual delays. Adding polytonic if time permits it.

**August 29**<br />
**Final Evaluation**
