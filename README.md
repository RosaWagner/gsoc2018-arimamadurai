# Adding Greek glyphs to the open source font Arima Madurai

### Project:

This project aims to extend the collection of fonts supporting Greek script in the Google Fonts Catalog. Indeed, today 19 serif fonts, 6 monospace fonts and 10 sans-serif fonts supporting Greek script are available. Moreover, only 2 fonts are explicitly intended for display text. 

Arima Madurai is a font created by Natanael Gana and Joana Correia of NDISCOVER — a Portuguese type foundry. It is a multiscripts display font with 8 weights from thin to black and have a strong calligraphic influence. It has a lot of personality so it can be recognisable in headlines or brand names uses. I value the quality of the design and thanks to its low contrasts, it allows a good legibility and rendering on screen.

Regarding the history of Greek script, it is interesting and challenging to design a typeface with a calligraphic feel: in terms of design but also in terms of study. There are remarkable examples of Greek punch cutting from the most talented historical figures. The challenge will be to respect that history while keeping a well anchored contemporary form. 

Arima Madurai already supports Tamil, Malayalam and Latin scripts and I would like to add Greek script to the glyphset. The fact that the font already supports multi scripts is a real benefit to the project: Arima Madurai already acts in non latin typographic environment and therefore displays a large set of shapes that can be used to match the Greek glyphs with the other ones.
