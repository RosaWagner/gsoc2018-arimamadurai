**180517-21** ~ *Firsts sketches for alpha and pi.* <br/>
Arima has vertical orientation and contrasts. Despite of its calligraphic feel, it is very straight. The drawing of the "a script" and the symbol "pi" in the Latin set follow this orientation. We could transfer these characteristics to the rest of the Greek set and the gray between the two scripts would be homogeneous. Another direction would be to take an orientation more specific to the Greek in order to have a more dancing set and more distinguished from the Latin set â€” the Greek writing beeing not determined by the same tools and the same ductus as Latin.

First letter to fourth were already designed in the original source (firsts alpha and pi could be used for the greek set). Last alpha and pi are firsts sketches.
